# Blockchain-based Data Marketplace for ML Models

## 🧠 Project Description
A decentralized marketplace where ML developers can list their models and consumers can buy access using cryptocurrency. This creates a transparent, secure, and efficient way to monetize ML models without intermediaries.

## 🚀 Project Vision
Our goal is to create a trustless ecosystem where machine learning models can be freely traded, ensuring ownership and incentivizing innovation in AI development.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Decentralized Listings**: Model creators list their models using an IPFS or on-chain hash.
- **Secure Payments**: ETH-based transactions ensure direct payments from buyers to model owners.
- **Transparency**: Smart contract maintains all transactions on-chain, viewable and verifiable by all.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with **IPFS or Filecoin** for model storage.
- **Access control** with NFTs or zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Reputation system** for model quality ranking.
- Support for **subscription-based** or **pay-per-use** models.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
- Solidity for smart contracts
- Ethereum blockchain
- IPFS for model storage (off-chain)
